# advent of code 2024

Using this for learning new languages.

================================================================================
Ocaml won i, unfortunately, dont have enough time to spend 3 hours everyday trying to figure out a way to solve the puzzle. This is 100% skill issue but im excited to come back to it when i get more fluent with functional programming. 

For now since ive been interested in go and it seems that go is stupid simple ill start doing aoc in go
